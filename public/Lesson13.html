            <li>can be retrieved as simple text and parsed into a javascript object</li>

            <li><code>send()</code>: sends the request <code>open()</code>: prepares the original request for the server.</li>
            
            <li><code>onreadystatechange</code>: if the request has been sent we can track this special event. The server will send data about the request through this event by returning a request object. Upon recieving it, it will have codes to verify the data</li>.
